# üì§ Telecord

**Export Discord chats (JSON + media) to Telegram using a simple CLI tool.**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This tool depends on [`discord-chat-exporter-cli`](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) for exporting your Discord messages first. Make sure to install and use that before proceeding.

---

## üì¶ What You Need First

### 1. Install [`discord-chat-exporter-cli`](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter)

```bash
dotnet tool install --global DiscordChatExporter.CLI
```

Or download a standalone binary from their [Releases](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases).

---

### 2. Export your Discord chat

```bash
discord-chat-exporter-cli export \
  -t "YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN" \
  -c YOUR_CHANNEL_ID \
  --media \
  -o media.json
```

> This will create:
>
> - `media.json` ‚Äì your exported messages
> - `media.json_Files/` ‚Äì folder containing any media (images, attachments, etc.)

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic CLI Mode

```bash

```

### Options

| Option              | Alias | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `--file <path>`     | `-f`  | Path to Discord JSON file                       |
| `--media <path>`    | `-m`  | Path to media folder (e.g., `media.json_Files`) |
| `--token <string>`  | `-t`  | Your Telegram bot token                         |
| `--chat <id>`       | `-c`  | Discord Channel ID (e.g., `-1001234567890`)     |
| `--delay <seconds>` | `-d`  | Delay between messages (default: 1)             |
| `--reverse`         | `-r`  | Send messages from newest to oldest             |
| `--verbose`         | `-v`  | Enable detailed logs                            |
| `--interactive`     |       | Launch step-by-step mode                        |

## üßô Interactive Mode

No need to remember flags. Just run:

```bash
telecord --interactive
```

You‚Äôll be prompted step-by-step:

```
‚úî Path to Discord JSON file
‚úî Folder containing media files
‚úî Telegram Bot token
‚úî Telegram Chat ID
‚úî Delay between messages
‚úî Send newest messages first?
‚úî Enable verbose logging?
```

---

## üß™ Example

```bash
telecord -f media.json -m media.json_Files -t 123456:ABCDEF123 -c -1009876543210 --delay 0.5 --reverse
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. You export your messages from Discord using `discord-chat-exporter-cli`
2. Telecord parses the `.json` file
3. Media files are uploaded first
4. Messages are then sent one-by-one to your Telegram chat
5. You can control the delay, order, and see progress in real-time

It uses:

- Telegram's Bot API (via [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios))
- Graceful error handling
- Verbose logging for debugging
